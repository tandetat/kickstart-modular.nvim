require 'lazy-plugins'
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.

-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
-- with the first argument being the link and the following
-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
--

-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
--
-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
--
-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
--
-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
--
--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
--
-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
--
--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
-- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
